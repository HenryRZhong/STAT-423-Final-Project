# Data description

The data used for this project is the Salary_Data dataset from Kaggle, found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data/data)

The description of the data set does not say where the data is from geographically. However, the data set creator did respond to a comment asking what unit the salary data was in, saying that it was in Indian Rupees(INR). Given this, it is most likely that this data set is from India.
